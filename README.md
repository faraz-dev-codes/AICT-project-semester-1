# AICT-project-semester-1
This project is a frontend restaurant website developed as part of my AICT 1st Semester project. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and includes sections such as menu display, ordering interface, and basic user interaction. The project focuses on responsive design, clean UI, and proper file structure.
